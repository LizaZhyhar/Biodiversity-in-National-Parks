# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks
In this project I interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.  I try to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.
